        <h2>Civil Geotechnical Engineering</h2>
        <p>We provide an array of geotechnical services consisting of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Geotechnical investigations and consultancy</li>
            <li>Engineering geology for civil engineering projects</li>
            <li>Geophysical investigations for civil engineering projects</li>
            <li>Geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring</li>
            <li>Geo-hazard mapping, assessment of cavities and slope stability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We can deliver geotechnical solutions for small subdivisions to large facilities and linear developments over hundreds of kilometres for roads, rails, and pipelines. Recognising the risks associated with lack of site investigation data, our staff combine geophysical investigation techniques for ground investigation with traditional techniques. This enables technically robust and cost-effective investigations and designs to be carried out. Our approach enables us to deliver economical solutions for developments in soft ground and high-risk ground such as karst land, collapsing soils, or swelling reactive clays.</p>
